# Why
I'll be using this blog as a sort of "road book," so you can expect a mix of topics that may occasionally appear random or loosely connected. Primarily, I'm compiling my own notes here so I can keep track of them and easily search through them later.
I'm sharing this publicly in case someone else finds it helpful. After all, we've all benefited from stumbling upon a blog post that answered exactly what we were looking for and saved us hours.

# What
A selection of topics I will be exploring and developing, primarily focused on software development, technical subjects, and maker-related areas.
